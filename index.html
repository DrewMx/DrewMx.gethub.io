			<h3>About Me</h3>
			
			<p>I am Andrew Maddox and new to studying programming and web devlopement. I have grown up in the world of computers and built my own since the age of 14. I have loved using them for as long as I can remember. My father is a computer programmer as well so it seems like a no brainer that I would like it too. However, it took me a long time to realize this is what I wanted to do for a career. I'm glad I did because not only do I love it, I also finally have a direction and motivation in my life.</p>

			<h3>Current Status of DrewMx</h3>
			
			<p>The webpage itself is to a point I'm happy with. I have created a Blog and LinkedIn page. Now I am going to update them with content. That is all for now, I am thinking of a new project to work on as well. </p>
